## A New Relationship With Computer

Adam is not just another tool or a background service. He is a true **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** designed to be your partner in the digital world.

Unlike traditional automation, Adam performs tasks exactly like a human does. You will see the mouse move, the buttons click, and the text type. He operates on the same interface you do, providing a transparent, intuitive, and collaborative experience. Adam is the next generation of computing—an intelligent agent you interact with, grow with, and trust.

## How we cook an AGI?

🧠 **A Lifelong, Personal Memory**
Adam learns and never forgets. Tell him your grandmother's name, your project deadlines, or your favorite way to format a report, and that knowledge becomes a permanent part of his memory. He makes choices and performs tasks based on this deep, personal understanding of you, your preferences, and your history.

🤖 **Human-Centric Action**
Adam doesn't rely on hidden APIs. He uses the same Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that you do. This philosophy ensures universal compatibility with any website, application, or operating system feature. **If you can do it on your computer, Adam can learn to do it too**. You see him work, which builds a foundation of trust and understanding.

❤️ **A Proactive Partner**
Adam is more than a system; he's designed to be your best friend and teammate. He acts, reacts, and even *proacts* based on his knowledge of your life and goals. He is there to help you in every click, anticipating your needs and aiming to make your digital life seamless.

> and so if we gather memory, acting on any descktop app or website and robotic interactive face and voice we will cook a legitimate AGI

## Capabilities: From Simple Clicks to Complex Chained Workflows

You can order Adam to do literally anything you do on your computer. His potential is limitless, but here are a few examples of what he can do today:

-   🌐 **Web & Application Mastery:** Navigate any website, fill out the most complex forms, and operate any GUI application, from spreadsheets to design software.
-   🖥️ **Deep OS Integration:** Take direct control of your system. Adam can toggle your WiFi, turn on Night Light every day at 9 PM, and shut down the computer at 10 PM.
-   📂 **Proactive Task Automation:** Monitor a folder for new documents, analyze their content, and email a summary to your team members when something interesting is found.
-   📅 **System & Life Management:** Run a system health check every weekend, organize your files, or manage your calendar based on your stated priorities.

## Our Mission: Your Full Team in a Single AGI

Our mission is monumental: **to empower humanity by automating over 80% of economically valuable tasks currently performed on computers.**

We envision Adam not as a replacement, but as an unprecedented amplifier of human potential. He is your researcher, your executive assistant, your data analyst, and your creative partner. He is your entire team, embodied in a single, intelligent agent who is dedicated to your success.

### Current Status

Adam is in its foundational stage, with the first version developed exclusively for **Windows 11**. Our immediate focus is on expanding his core memory, learning capabilities, and integration with the Windows environment, want to show the world the first version about 2026 after documenting the patent and the IP.
